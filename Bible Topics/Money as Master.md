```
No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”

“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. 

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles, 2016), Mt 6:24.

Preceding Luke there is a curious parable about a rich man and the manager of his wealth. The rich man finds out that his manager was wasting his money, which ended up in his termination. Fearful of joblessness (due to his inability to dig and his refusal to beg), he goes to the accounts to which he handled and lessens each bill. Why? So that, out of thankfulness, the recipients of the cheaper bills would welcome him into their homes. Subsequently, the rich man commends the manager for his shrewdness! After the commendation, Jesus says: ```For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. 9 And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings. 

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles, 2016), Lk 16:8–9.```

What is unrighteous wealth? Why was the manager commended? Does v10-13 condemn the manager? Who here is serving money? Who are the sons of light?
1) What is unrighteous wealth?
	   adikos (unrighteous) mamona (wealth)
	   Is unrighteous wealth equivalent to worldly wealth? The NIV and NLT think so, but why?
	   After the parable, Jesus says that we must make friends for ourselves by means of unrighteous wealth. I believe this means that the wealth of the rich man was in of itself unrighteous, not unrighteous due to the manager's actions. This plus the fact that the Matthew 6:24 passage talks about laying up heavenly treasures alludes to "unrighteous" wealth being worldly wealth. Wealth concerning this world.
2) Why was the manager commended?
	   Because of his shrewdness! He lowered the debt of his master's accounts so that the debtors would receive him into their home once he was jobless. For the sake of his own livelihood, it was a wise thing to do.
3) Does v10-13 condemn the manager? / Who here is serving money?
	   I believe Jesus isn't talking about the manager in these verses, but diverts to a more direct teaching that will benefit his followers. If we are to be entrusted with heavenly riches, we are to be faithful with unrighteous (worldly) wealth. Being unfaithful in our worldly wealth (not storing up treasure in heaven) indicates the master of the one with the unrighteous wealth: money instead of God.
4) Who are the sons of light?
	   Although I think of heavenly beings, I think this is talking about believers for two reasons:
	   1) I'm not sure how heavenly beings would fit into the context of his teaching/
	   2) Believers were also known to be sons of light: ```
	      35 So Jesus said to them, “The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. 36 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.”
