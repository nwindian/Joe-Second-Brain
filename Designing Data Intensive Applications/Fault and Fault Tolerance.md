Things that can go wrong in a piece of software. Systems that anticipate these are called fault-tolerant.

## Fault vs Failure
__Not__ the same as a failure. A fault is defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec.
Failure - When the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.

As data volumes and computing demands increased, application began using larger numbers of machines which increases the rate of hardware faults.
