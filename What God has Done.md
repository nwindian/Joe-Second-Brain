1) Given me salvation
3) Aligned (and is currently) aligning my character to his. I once did not love Godly things, and I enjoyed being selfish and cruel to others. I stole and was a vandal. I was sexually immoral. I live for him because of what he did for me. He has changed my life.
4) In the midst of my ordeal with Canada, he has brought me through with a wife and child. 
5) He sent me a friend, Ziven, when I needed him.
6) He provided me with financial needs when an events came up. (Lawyer, Taxes).
7) He sent me to Alabama, where I grew as a man of God. Answering my prayers.
8) He puts food on our table.
9) He has given me a job.
10) He has given me a brain, with which I can think about good things.
