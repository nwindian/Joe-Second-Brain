Son of a bishop
~ AD 138 (Arrived in Rome)
[[Introduction to The Old Testament]] Pg 5

- Studied under a Gnostic teacher and ended up developing an intellectual system upon the concepts of philosophical dualism.
- He was the first of many subsequent critics of Biblical writings to apply canons of a subjective nature in the prosecution of his activities.
- Adopted a literalistic interpretation of the text, and arrived at the conclusion that God was weak, unjust, lacking in prescience, and essentially fickle.
- Ejected the OT completely from his canon of Scripture, which in the end consisted mainly of Paulin material along with an expurgated edition of Luke
- RK Harrison ([[Introduction to The Old Testament]]) asserts that his criticism of the OT cannot be regarded as scientific in any sense of that term, since they were dictated by purely subjective philosophical considerations, but they are of importance in any study of the growth of Biblical criticism generally.
